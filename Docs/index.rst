The AI Model Efficiency Toolkit (AIMET) is a software toolkit for quantizing and compressing trained models. The primary objective of model optimization is to facilitate its deployment on edge devices like mobile phones or laptops.

AIMET employs post-training and fine-tuning techniques to minimize accuracy loss during quantization and compression.

AIMET supports models from the PyTorch, TensorFlow/Keras, and ONNX frameworks.

Quick Start
===========

To quickly install and begin using AIMET with PyTorch, see the :doc:`Quick Start Guide <../install/quick-start>`.

Installation
============

For other install options, including for TensorFlow and ONNX platforms or to run AIMET in a Docker container, see :doc:`Installation <../install/index>`.

User Guide
==========

For a high-level explanation of how to use AIMET to optimize a model, see the :doc:`Quantization User Guide <../userguide/index>`.

Quantization Simulation Guide
=============================

Quantization simulation (QuantSim) emulates the behavior of quantized hardware in a model running on floating point hardware. For a guide to quantization simulation and its related techniques, see the :doc:`Quantization Simulation Guide <../quantsim/index>`.

Feature Guide
=============

For instructions on applying individual AIMET features, see the :doc:`Feature Guide <../featureguide/index>`.

Example Notebooks
=================

To view end-to-end examples of model quantization and compression, and to download the examples in Jupyter notebook format, see the :doc:`Example Notebooks <../examples/index>` page.

API Reference
=============

For a detailed look at the AIMET API, see the :doc:`API Reference <../apiref/index>`.

Release Notes
=============

For information about new features in this release, see the :doc:`Release Notes <release_notes>`.

Glossary
========

See the :doc:`glossary <../glossary>` for explanations of terms and acronyms used on this website.
